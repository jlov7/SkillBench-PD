## Open Questions
- None currently.

## Resolved
- Deployment target: Vercel recommended for shared static reports; GitHub Pages documented as fallback.
- UI scope: static report output (no full web app in v1).
- Public demo access: if Vercel deployment protection is enabled in account settings, disable it for the `showcase` project to avoid `401` on public links.
